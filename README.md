# DeepLearning_in_video_scene_parsing
 graduation project that includes machine learning to identify cars, humans, bikes, and trucks in a video and draw a box around them for identification.

This project is about using a model trained using Udacity self-driving dataset to later identify cars, humans, bikers, and trucks.
After the EfficientDet model is finished training, the training data is transferred to the video processing model.
The video processing model check each frame from the inputted video scene to check for the previous mentioned item then draw a detection box around it for item category and accuracy
